\section{Introduction}
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s pose significant challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. Both diseases are progressive and often lead to significant cognitive and physical impairments. Traditional diagnostic methods can be invasive, time-consuming, and expensive, necessitating innovative approaches to improve early detection.

Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for diagnosing complex diseases by analyzing patterns within large datasets \cite{b1}. In this paper, we explore the state of the art of ML techniques, including XGBoost \cite{b1}, Random Forests \cite{b2}, Logistic Regression, SVMs \cite{b3}, and Decision Trees \cite{b7}, highlighting their applications in diagnosing Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Additionally, we discuss how these predictive models can be extended to suggest personalized activities that support patients' cognitive and physical well-being.

To complement ML predictions, we integrate a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) framework to evaluate and rank personalized activity recommendations. MADM methods, such as AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process), TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), and ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality), provide structured decision-making tools to consider multiple factors, such as safety, engagement, and required resources.

\section{State of the Art}
This section provides an overview of the theoretical foundations and existing technologies related to the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in healthcare.

\subsection{Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables machines to simulate intelligent human behavior, including learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on algorithms capable of learning from data and improving performance over time \cite{b1}. These technologies are increasingly used in healthcare to identify patterns in medical data and support decision-making, especially in diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

\subsection{Learning Paradigms}
ML encompasses various learning paradigms, each suited to different types of problems. This study focuses on supervised learning, a paradigm where models are trained with labeled data, associating inputs with desired outputs \cite{b2}. Supervised learning is highly effective for tasks like disease diagnosis, where labeled datasets are available. However, it requires large amounts of high-quality data, which can be costly and time-consuming to obtain.

\subsection{Technologies and Tools}
The implementation of ML models for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diagnosis relies on the following tools and frameworks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Python}: A versatile programming language widely used for scientific computing and data analysis \cite{b3}.
    \item \textbf{Scikit-learn}: A comprehensive Python library that provides a wide range of Machine Learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Decision Trees, as well as utilities for model evaluation and validation \cite{b1, b2}.
    \item \textbf{Pandas and NumPy}: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical computing, enabling efficient preprocessing and analysis of medical datasets \cite{b1}.
    \item \textbf{Matplotlib}: A plotting library in Python used for visualizing the results of data analysis and model performance metrics, such as accuracy and ROC-AUC curves \cite{b14}.
    \item \textbf{Jupyter Notebooks}: An interactive environment for developing and visualizing ML workflows, used extensively in the initial phases of this study \cite{b2}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Machine Learning Algorithms}
Several ML algorithms have been applied to healthcare datasets for disease diagnosis. This subsection provides an overview of the main techniques used in this study:
\subsubsection{XGBoost}
XGBoost, a scalable and efficient implementation of gradient boosting, has demonstrated high accuracy in medical diagnosis \cite{b1}. Its ability to handle missing data and prioritize important features makes it particularly effective for healthcare datasets.

\subsubsection{Random Forests}
Random Forests are ensemble learning methods known for their robustness and interpretability. Their ability to reduce overfitting while maintaining high accuracy has been applied in various diagnostic tasks, including neurodegenerative diseases \cite{b2}.

\subsubsection{Logistic Regression}
Logistic Regression is a classical statistical method often used as a baseline in medical studies. While simple, it is effective for binary classification problems such as the presence or absence of a disease \cite{b7}.

\subsubsection{Support Vector Machines (SVMs)}
SVMs are widely used in high-dimensional datasets, making them suitable for analyzing medical data with numerous features. Their effectiveness in pattern recognition has been proven in imaging and biomarker studies \cite{b3}.

\subsubsection{Decision Tree Classifiers}

For example, \cite{b7} showed the effectiveness of Decision Trees in classifying patient risk levels in various clinical scenarios.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis and MADM}
MCDA encompasses a set of methods and processes that evaluate and rank alternatives based on multiple criteria, often with conflicting objectives \cite{b8}. It provides a systematic approach to decision-making, particularly in scenarios where trade-offs between criteria are required. MCDA is widely applied in healthcare, enabling decisions about treatment options, resource allocation, and personalized care recommendations.

\subsubsection{Types of MCDA Methods}
MCDA methods are broadly classified into three categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Value-Based Methods:} Methods such as AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) assign scores to alternatives based on weighted criteria.
    \item \textbf{Outranking Methods:} Techniques like ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality) compare alternatives pairwise, identifying those that outperform others based on concordance and discordance thresholds \cite{b12}.
    \item \textbf{Rule-Based Methods:} These rely on predefined rules or thresholds to evaluate alternatives, often used in healthcare decision-making systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Applications in Healthcare}
MCDA methods have been used to optimize healthcare decisions in areas such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Treatment Planning:} Prioritizing interventions based on effectiveness and cost.
    \item \textbf{Resource Allocation:} Balancing limited resources with patient needs.
    \item \textbf{Activity Recommendations:} Evaluating and recommending activities tailored to individual patient profiles \cite{b8}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
The methodology for this project integrates Machine Learning (ML) models with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases and recommend personalized activities. The following steps outline the approach:

\subsection{Data Collection}
Two datasets were used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Alzheimer’s Dataset:} Sourced from Kaggle \cite{b4}, it includes biomarker and demographic information.
    \item \textbf{Parkinson’s Dataset:} Sourced from Kaggle \cite{b6}, it contains features such as vocal metrics, demographic details, and clinical data relevant for Parkinson’s diagnosis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
The datasets were preprocessed to ensure consistency and quality, using the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Feature Imputation:} Missing data were addressed using imputation techniques, such as mean or median replacement, to ensure that incomplete records did not negatively affect model training.
    \item \textbf{Feature Encoding:} Categorical variables, such as demographic details, were encoded into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding, depending on the feature type.
    \item \textbf{Feature Normalization:} Continuous features were normalized or standardized to ensure comparability across variables, improving convergence during training and avoiding biases caused by scale differences.
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering:} New features were created based on domain knowledge, such as combining existing features into composite metrics (e.g., age group categorization or risk scores).
    \item \textbf{Feature Selection:} Features that contributed the most to model performance were identified and selected using techniques like recursive feature elimination (RFE) and feature importance scores from tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest or XGBoost).
    \item \textbf{Dealing with Data Imbalances:} Oversampling methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) or undersampling were applied to balance the dataset and prevent models from being biased towards majority classes.
    \item \textbf{Train-Test Split:} The datasets were divided into 80\% training and 20\% testing subsets to evaluate model performance effectively.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithm Implementation}
The following algorithms were implemented using the Scikit-learn library:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{XGBoost:} Used for its feature selection capabilities and robustness in handling missing data \cite{b1}.
    \item \textbf{Random Forests:} Applied for ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting \cite{b2}.
    \item \textbf{Logistic Regression:} A baseline model for binary classification tasks, providing interpretable results \cite{b7}.
    \item \textbf{Support Vector Machines (SVMs):} Leveraged for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and pattern recognition tasks \cite{b3}.
    \item \textbf{Decision Trees:} Used for their interpretability and ability to model complex decision boundaries \cite{b7}.
\end{itemize}

The models were trained and validated using the preprocessed datasets, with hyperparameters tuned through grid search.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
To assess model performance, the following metrics were used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy:} Proportion of correctly predicted samples across all classes \cite{b13}.
    \item \textbf{Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:} Metrics for evaluating classification performance, particularly for imbalanced datasets \cite{b13}.
    \item \textbf{ROC-AUC:} Used to measure the ability of the models to distinguish between classes \cite{b13}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration with MCDA}
The outputs of the ML models were combined with MCDA techniques to rank and recommend personalized activities for patients based on multiple criteria. This step involved:

\subsubsection{Activity Grouping and Criteria Definition}
Activities were grouped into categories (e.g., Cognitive Stimulation, Physical Exercise) and evaluated based on 13 predefined criteria, including cognitive stimulation potential, physical effort required, safety, and enjoyment.

\subsubsection{MCDA Techniques}
Three MCDA algorithms were applied to rank activities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution):} Calculates the relative closeness of each activity to an ideal solution \cite{b10}.
    \item \textbf{AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process):} Assigns weights to criteria through pairwise comparisons, creating a hierarchy of importance \cite{b11}.
    \item \textbf{ELECTRE (Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality):} Uses concordance and discordance thresholds to identify the most suitable activities \cite{b12}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Validation and Iteration}
The ranked activities were validated against known preferences and feedback from caregivers and patients. Adjustments to criteria weights and model parameters were iteratively performed to refine the recommendations.

\subsection{Expected Outcomes}
The integration of ML and MCDA techniques is expected to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide high-accuracy predictions for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diagnosis.
    \item Deliver ranked recommendations for activities that align with patients’ therapeutic needs and preferences.
